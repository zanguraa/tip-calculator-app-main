Tip calculator app - [https://zanguraa.github.io/tip-calculator-app-main/]

Tip calculator was builded by me. It's my first experience with javascript and I'm happy. 

program is calculating tip amount and then divided by people amount.

negative numbers in bill amount and people amount isn't allowed, also not working while people amount not will be more then 0 etc.
